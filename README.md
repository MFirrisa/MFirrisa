Hello, welcome to my Github page! My name is Michael Firrisa. I am a pure mathematician by training. 
My interest has moved toward data science in recent years. I am particularly interested in machine learning
and its application to real-world problems. My strong interest in mathematics remains unchanged, however.
My ideal job is one where there is always a new challenge, and I get to use the skills I have acquired through
my studies.
